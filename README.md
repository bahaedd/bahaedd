### I'm a web developer with a vast array of knowledge in many different front end and back end languages, responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices.
### My objective is simply to be the best web developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do.
### I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by learning from more seasoned developers, remaining humble, and continuously making strides to learn all that I can about development.
